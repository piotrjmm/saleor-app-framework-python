# HTTP Webhook Event Handling

While it's not necessary for every Saleor app to receive domain events from Saleor it is possible, as described in [:saleor-saleor: Saleor's docs](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.0/developer/extending#apps).

To configure your app to listen to HTTP webhooks issued from Saleor you need to **register your handlers** similarly as you would register your FastAPI endpoints.

## Setting up the Saleor App

### Getting Webhook details

The framework ensures that the webhook comes from a trusted source but to achieve that it needs to be provided with a way of retrieving the `webhook_secret` your app stored when the `save_app_data` was invoked (upon app installation). To do that you need to provide the `SaleorApp` with an async function doing just that.

```python linenums="1"
from saleor_app.schemas.core import DomainName, WebhookData


async def get_webhook_details(saleor_domain: DomainName) -> WebhookData:
    return WebhookData(
        webhook_id="webhook-id",
        webhook_secret_key="webhook-secret-key",
    ) # (1)

```

1. :material-database: Typically the data would be taken from a database

The function takes the `saleor_domain` and must return a `WebhookData` Pydantic model instance

### Enabling the webhook router

The framework provides a special webhook router that allows you to use many different endpoints under the `/webhook` route. That router needs to be enabled with the `get_webhook_details` function:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="16"
from saleor_app.app import SaleorApp
from saleor_app.schemas.core import DomainName, WebhookData


async def get_webhook_details(saleor_domain: DomainName) -> WebhookData:
    return WebhookData(
        webhook_id="webhook-id",
        webhook_secret_key="webhook-secret-key",
    )


app = SaleorApp(
    #[...]
)

app.include_webhook_router(get_webhook_details=get_webhook_details)
```
### Defining webhook handlers

An HTTP webhook handler is a function that is exactly like one that one would use as a FastAPI endpoint. The difference is that we register those with a special router.

An example of a HTTP webhook handler is:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="21-26"
from saleor_app.app import SaleorApp
from saleor_app.deps import saleor_domain_header # (1)
from saleor_app.schemas.handlers import SaleorEventType
from saleor_app.schemas.webhook import Webhook
from saleor_app.schemas.core import DomainName, WebhookData


async def get_webhook_details(saleor_domain: DomainName) -> WebhookData:
    return WebhookData(
        webhook_id="webhook-id",
        webhook_secret_key="webhook-secret-key",
    )


app = SaleorApp(
    #[...]
)
app.include_webhook_router(get_webhook_details=get_webhook_details)


@app.webhook_router.http_event_route(SaleorEventType.PRODUCT_CREATED)
async def product_created(
    payload: List[Webhook],
    saleor_domain=Depends(saleor_domain_header)  # (2)
):
    await do_something(payload, saleor_domain)
```

1. :information_source: `saleor_app.deps` contains a set of FastAPI dependencies that you might find useful
2. :information_source: since `product_created` is just a FastAPI endpoint you have access to everything a usual endpoint would, like `request: Request`

If your app is bigger and you need to import your endpoints from a different module you can:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="6 22-26"
from saleor_app.app import SaleorApp
from saleor_app.schemas.handlers import SaleorEventType
from saleor_app.schemas.webhook import Webhook
from saleor_app.schemas.core import DomainName, WebhookData

from my_app.webhook_handlers import product_created


async def get_webhook_details(saleor_domain: DomainName) -> WebhookData:
    return WebhookData(
        webhook_id="webhook-id",
        webhook_secret_key="webhook-secret-key",
    )


app = SaleorApp(
    #[...]
)
app.include_webhook_router(get_webhook_details=get_webhook_details)


@app.webhook_router.http_event_route(
    SaleorEventType.PRODUCT_CREATED
)(product_created)
```

### Support for subscription webhook payloads

The difference between subscriptions and the basic approach for webhook handlers is that we add an optional argument for the subscription query, and also a more general payload parameter type in the endpoint. This is because the structure of the subscription payload sent by Saelor is different in this case.

You can find documentation for Saleor subscription here: [Saleor's docs - subscription](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.0/developer/extending/apps/subscription-webhook-payloads)

An example of a HTTP subscription webhook handler is:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="21-26"
from saleor_app.app import SaleorApp
from saleor_app.deps import saleor_domain_header # (1)
from saleor_app.schemas.handlers import SaleorEventType
from saleor_app.schemas.webhook import Webhook
from saleor_app.schemas.core import DomainName, WebhookData


async def get_webhook_details(saleor_domain: DomainName) -> WebhookData:
    return WebhookData(
        webhook_id="webhook-id",
        webhook_secret_key="webhook-secret-key",
    )


app = SaleorApp(
    #[...]
)
app.include_webhook_router(get_webhook_details=get_webhook_details)


SUBSCRIPTION_ORDER_CREATED = "subscription { event { ... on DraftOrderCreated { order { id status created } } } }"

@app.webhook_router.http_event_route(SaleorEventType.ORDER_CREATED, subscription_query=SUBSCRIPTION_ORDER_CREATED)
async def order_created(
    payload: Request,
    saleor_domain=Depends(saleor_domain_header)  # (2)
):
    await do_something(payload, saleor_domain)
```

### Reinstall the app

Neither Saleor nor the app will automatically update the registered webhooks, you need to reinstall the app in Saleor if it was already installed.
